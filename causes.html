    <h3><u>Industrial Waste</u></h3>
    <section>
     
      <p>Industrial waste is the waste produced by industrial activity which includes any material that is rendered useless during a manufacturing process such as that of factories, mills, and mining operations. Types of industrial waste include dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete, scrap metal, oil, solvents, chemicals, scrap lumber, even vegetable matter from restaurants. Industrial waste may be solid, semi-solid or liquid in form. It may be hazardous waste (some types of which are toxic) or non-hazardous waste. Industrial waste may pollute the nearby soil or adjacent water bodies, and can contaminate groundwater, lakes, streams, rivers or coastal waters.<br> Industrial waste is often mixed into municipal waste, making accurate assessments difficult. An estimate for the US goes as high as 7.6 billion tons of industrial waste produced annually, as of 2017. Most countries have enacted legislation to deal with the problem of industrial waste, but strictness and compliance regimes vary. Enforcement is always an issue.<br><br>

      Industrial wastes are produced in a large amount every year globally. The deposition of such huge amount of wastes in common land causes a lot of environmental hazards. Employing these industrial wastes in water remediation serves as an environment-friendly, cost-effective, and efficient approach for their utilization. Adsorption is one of the most valuable scientific tools for industries as well as academia. It has a wide range of applications and is especially beneficial for environmental remediation due to its explicit utility in the purification of water from a wide range of impurities such as toxic heavy metals, dyes, organic pollutants, inorganic ions, pharmaceutical wastes, and other contaminants. Some of the industrial wastes such as fly ash, lignin, red mud, blast furnace slag, sludge, and dust can be used as efficient adsorbents for the removal of toxic impurities from water. Efficient and novel adsorbents are the ones that purify wastewater as well as contribute to the minimization of the cost of the remediation process and the recyclization of industrial wastes, simultaneously reducing environmental hazards. This chapter consists of discussion on a few industrial wastes and their modification to form low-cost, novel adsorbents for wastewater treatment. Production and utilization of the industrial wastes, removal of specific impurities along with the challenges of the removal process, and the factors and trends observed in the adsorption process are highlighted.</p>

    <h3><u>Agricultural Runoff</u></h3>
    <section>
      
      <p>Agricultural runoff is water that flows off of farms and carries with it fertilizers, pesticides, and other chemicals. These chemicals can contaminate soil and waterways.Agricultural soils can be contaminated with a wide range of compounds, from both direct inputs (point source pollution) such as the application of pesticides and fertilizers and indirect inputs (diffuse pollution) such as flooding and atmospheric deposition. Polluted soils also represent a secondary emission source of contaminants to surrounding air, surface waters, groundwater, and subsequently to oceans.

        The main sources of soil pollution in agricultural areas can be grouped as: i) pesticides; ii) mineral fertilizers; iii) organic fertilizers (manure and sewage sludge); iv) wastewater for irrigation; v) plastic materials such as films for mulching and greenhouses, drip irrigation tubes and empty packaging; vi) and rural wastes. Different contaminants are linked to each source.</p><p>According to the International Code of Conduct on Pesticide Management (FAO and WHO, 2014), pesticides are defined as “any substance, or mixture of substances of chemical or biological ingredients intended for repelling, destroying or controlling any pest, or regulating plant growth”. Pesticides include, but are not limited to, insecticides; fungicides; herbicides; rodenticides; molluscicides; nematicides; plant growth regulators (such as defoliants, desiccants, agents for setting, thinning or preventing the premature fall of fruit), and substances applied to crops either before or after harvest to protect the commodity from deterioration during storage and transport. In addition to agricultural use, pesticides are also used to control vectors of human or animal disease, and this widespread global use can impact soil organisms, wildlife and non-target plant species, and human health (FAO and ITPS, 2017; Kim, Kabir and Jahan, 2017; Newman, 1948; Sánchez-Bayo, 2011).</p><p>Pests and crop diseases have existed since the beginning of agriculture and humans have continuously sought practical solutions to reduce crop yield losses (Sánchez-Bayo, 2011). The first pesticides were based on inorganic chemicals such as sulphur, copper, mercury and arsenic compounds (Unsworth, 2010). By the end of the first half of the 20th century, the synthetic pesticide industry began to develop organic pest control compounds, which were seen as a miraculous solution (part of the “Green Revolution”) to the world’s growing demand for food and to major public health concerns such as malaria and typhus. The pesticide industry has continued to develop to the present day, with more than 800 active ingredients being commercialized in the global market (Sánchez-Bayo, 2011). The European Union pesticide database lists 1 426 pesticide active ingredients of which 476 are approved for use, 49 are pending approval, and the remaining 901 are banned or otherwise not approved for use (European union, 2016). Between 2000 and 2017 there has been continued growth in pesticide use on all continents, with a wide disparity between them (Table 2), ranging from around 8 percent increase in Europe to 84 percent and 104 percent in Oceania and South America respectively (FAOSTAT, 2019a). The UNEP report on Pesticides and Fertilizers (UNEP, 2021) identifies that the rate of use of pesticide active ingredient per unit of crop land has increased from 1.9 kg/ha in 1990 to 3.3 kg/ha in 2016, an increase of 75 percent (Figure 2). With the growth in global population, demand for food is increasing but due to the limited availability of new agricultural land, intensification of agricultural production will be required. However concerns over the unsustainability of the reliance on pesticides and fertilizers to provide this intensification into the future has led to calls for the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices (FAO, 2011).</p>

    <h3><u>Improper Disposal of Household Chemicals</u></h3>
    <section>
      
      <p><strong><h3>Abstract</h3></strong>
        Household hazardous waste (HHW) is not always separated for proper handling before disposal. When disposed improperly to landfills and municipal treatment plants, these products can have significant impact on the environment. Although HHW is a small portion of municipal solid waste, the presence of HHW in solid management facilities that are not equipped to handle them can have problematic effects, resulting in environmental pollution, damage to facilities, and even injury to workers. In many countries, HHW is not subject to legislation unless separated from other household waste because of its small percentage and the challenge in enforcement. In addition, there is no standard definition of HHW globally; therefore, what constitutes to HHW in one country may not be in another. Government legislation and schemes such as Extended Producer Responsibility play a vital role in encouraging proper disposal among consumers, especially when they are convenient and accessible. In this chapter, hazardous household products in different countries are considered along with common improper and acceptable disposal methods. Furthermore, the impacts of improper disposal on the environment are explored with an emphasis on landfill leachate and wastewater treatment plant effluent. Finally, current legislation and programs that encourage proper disposal are discussed.</p>
    <br><p>Household waste is something that is common among most, if not all, living residences. Like any industrial facilities that handle potentially hazardous materials, households too dispose and use hazardous substances. The chemical complexion in the waste substances makes it so if disposed improperly, it could ignite, explode, poison, or corrode. Household hazardous waste (HHW) becomes what it is once thrown away. Methods of the waste being improperly disposed is pouring the substance down the drain, into storm sewers, on the ground, and throwing it in among the trash. It may not be obvious that these substances, once disposed, will be a danger, but particular varieties of HHWs have the prospective to:</p>
    <p>* cause somatic injury to sanitation workers;</p>
    <p>* if poured down drains or toilets, adulterate septic tanks or wastewater treatment systems;</p>
    <p>* pollute—if poured down storm sewers—bodies of water;</p>
    <p>* become a danger to young or unknowing children and pets if left open in the house;</p>
    <p>* contaminate ground and/or surface water that is used as a way of obtaining drinking water, if directed to exposed landfills.</p>
    <p>A big problem that occurs/can occur through improper disposal of HHW would be the deconstruction that the sewage treatment plants are able to obtain. These plants are not able to deconstruct HHW compounds that people would drain or flush, which will end up traveling into lakes and rivers, unprocessed. As a result, one of the main releasers of dioxins and furans was from sewage systems. The substances proved to threaten human health due to the fact that they were highly carcinogenic. Other than the fact of the carcinogenic dangers, interference with the treatments plants could transpire. The toxins that would be processed could poison the microorganisms in the biological process. That would bring us to the position where our water systems would be more susceptible to harmful contaminants.</p>
    <p>As a given, hazardous waste is poisonous to all life forms, exposure of such hazardous substances to any living organism (plants and animals) could devitalize it. As a consequence, to the environment, hazardous waste could diminish natural resources and be contaminating to humans. Giving the young/fetuses, whether human or animal, exposure to these hazards would be substantially dangerous, as they are in a process or rapid growth. Introduction to chemicals for the living body would also interfere with biological structure, causing malfunction of organs and limbs.</p>
    <p>In addition to the effects to the human and animal bodies, hazardous waste would hinder plant growth. The impeding of plants that are of much use to the human race through manufacturing and consumption would affect our habitat. If the plants were slowly changing, for the worse, it would affect the animals that are needed for food, farm work, and would cause a whole new era of extinction.</p>
    <p>If our plant growth can affect our way of living easily, dumping the HHW into landfills gives us a much bigger problem. Landfills that are improperly maintained are major problem; even if they seem to be isolated from any contact, they can contaminate the environment around them. These landfills produce foul-smelling and toxin gases. Along with the gases and toxins, landfills generate leachate, which can travel to our water sources of lakes, rivers, and oceans. This would dig us into a deeper problem of both environmental and human existences. Thereby, leaving HHW unattended and improperly disposed could potentially destroy the ecosystem.</p>
    <p>It is estimated that in countries within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), household waste contributes to 67% of 540 million tons of municipal solid waste (MSW). The estimated amount of HHW varies considerably due to an unclear definition of what constitutes to household waste as opposed to MSW. In the USA, for the Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), household products that contain corrosive, toxic, ignitable, or reactive ingredients are considered to be HHW. In general, the HHW is a solid, semisolid, or nonaqueous liquid that can cause or significantly contribute to potential hazard to human health or environment when it is improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of, or otherwise managed. The portion of HHW in MSW has been estimated to be from less than 0.01–3.4% in several studies. The large variability is due to lack of standard definition as to what constitutes HHW, variability in generation, variability in weighing methods, and limited sample size. Nevertheless, 1% by weight is widely accepted as the fraction of HHW in MSW. Because of this small percentage of HHW produced, households are not practically considered to be hazardous waste producers [1]. While HHW represents a relatively small proportion of current urban solid residues, it is the most toxic part of the waste stream.</p>
    <p><strong>Potential risks of improper disposal of HHW</strong><br><br>Unavailable facilities for proper HHW management discourage even their voluntary participation. While the products in the HHW list vary from country to country, below are categories that represent majority if not all products that can be classified as HHW:</p>
    <p>* Photochemicals</p>
    <p>* Pesticides</p>
    <p>* Mercury-containing wastes</p>
    <p>* Nonedible oil and fat</p>
    <p>* Paints, inks, resins, and adhesives</p>
    <p>* Waste electrical and electronic equipment</p>

    <h3><u>Deforestation</u></h3>
    <section>
      
      <p>Deforestation is the permanent removal of trees from a forest. Deforestation can include clearing the land for farming or livestock, or using the timber for fuel, construction or manufacturing.  

        Forests cover more than 30% of  Earth's land surface, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). These forested areas produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide (CO2), and are home to an estimated 80% of Earth's terrestrial species. Forests also are a source of  food, medicine and fuel for more than a billion people. Worldwide, forests provide 13.4 million people with jobs in the forest sector, and another 41 million people have jobs related to forests. 
        
        Forests are an important natural resource, but humans have destroyed substantial quantities of forested land. In North America, about half the forests in the eastern part of the continent were cut down for timber and farming between the 1600s and late 1800s, according to National Geographic. 
        
        </p>
        <p>Today, most deforestation is happening in the tropics. Areas that were inaccessible in the past are now within reach as people build new roads through the dense forests. The world has lost about 10% of its tropical tree cover since 2000, and nearly 47,000 square miles (121,000 square kilometers) were destroyed in 2019 alone, The New York Times reported in 2020.

          The World Bank estimates that about 3.9 million square miles (10 million square km) of forest have been lost since the beginning of the 20th century. In the past 25 years, forests shrank by 502,000 square miles (1.3 million square km) — an area bigger than the size of South Africa.</p>
          <p>Often, deforestation occurs when people cut or clear forested area to make way for agriculture or grazing. The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reports that just four commodities are mostly responsible for the vast majority of tropical deforestation: beef, soy, palm oil and wood products. UCS estimates that an area the size of Switzerland (14,800 square miles, or 38,300 square km) is lost to deforestation every year. 

            People often light fires to clear land for agricultural use. First, workers harvest valuable timber, then burn the remaining vegetation to make way for crops like soy, or for cattle grazing. In 2019, the number of human-lit fires in Brazil skyrocketed. As of August 2019, more than 80,000 fires burned in the Amazon, an increase of almost 80% from 2018, National Geographic reported. 
            
            Many forests are cleared to make way for palm oil plantations. Palm oil is the most commonly produced vegetable oil and is found in half of all supermarket products. Growing the trees that produce the oil requires the leveling of native forest and the destruction of local peatlands — which doubles the harmful effect on the ecosystem., The global palm oil market was valued at $36.71 billion in 2019 and has been "witnessing unprecedented growth," according to a 2020 report published by Business Wire. </p>

    <h3><u>Soil Erosion</u></h3>
    <section>
      
      <p>Soil Erosion is the natural process of wearing away of soil by wind, water, or ice. Erosion can be accelerated by human activities such as deforestation and overgrazing.</p>
<p>Soil erosion is a gradual process that occurs when the impact of water or wind detaches and removes soil particles, causing the soil to deteriorate. Soil deterioration and low water quality due to erosion and surface runoff have become severe problems worldwide. The problem may become so severe that the land can no longer be cultivated and must be abandoned. Many agricultural civilizations have declined due to land and natural resource mismanagement, and the history of such civilizations is a good reminder to protect our natural resources.</p>
<p>Erosion is a serious problem for productive agricultural land and for water quality concerns. Controlling the sediment must be an integral part of any soil management system to improve water and soil quality. Eroded topsoil can be transported by wind or water into streams and other waterways. Sediment is a product of land erosion and derives largely from sheet and rill erosion from upland areas, and to a lesser degree, from cyclic erosion activity in gullies and drainageways.</p>
  <p>The impact of soil erosion on water quality becomes significant, particularly as soil surface runoff. Sediment production and soil erosion are closely related. Therefore, the most effective way to minimize sediment production is the stabilization of the sediment source by controlling erosion. Several conservation practices can be used to control erosion but first you need to understand the factors affecting soil erosion. Soil erosion is the detachment and movement of soil particles from the point of origination through the action of water or wind. Thus, minimizing the impact of water or wind forces is the main objective for erosion control. Water erosion is the most pertinent erosion problem in Iowa.</p>
  <p>Soil erosion by water occurs when bare-sloped soil surface is exposed to rainfall, and the rainfall intensity exceeds the rate of soil intake, or infiltration rate, leading to soil-surface runoff. Soil erosion can occur in two stages: 1) detachment of soil particles by raindrop impact, splash, or flowing water; and 2) transport of detached particles by splash or flowing water. Therefore, soil erosion is a physical process requiring energy, and its control requires certain measures to dissipate this energy.</p>
  <p><strong>Types ofSoil Erosion</strong></p>
  <p>1)Water Erosion<br>As the name suggests, this soil erosion type is caused by water and implies topsoil removal after rainfall, snowmelt, floods, or poorly managed irrigation. Thus, it can occur both due to weather extremities or farming activities. In bare terrains and under intense rainfall or melting, destruction by water happens faster.</p>
  <p>2)Wind Erosion<br>Another erosion-inducing factor is dust storms destroying the topsoil. Dust storms have been a frequent phenomenon in the last decades, especially in arid places. Erodibility increases if the earth is even, fine, and dry. Conversely, ridges reduce wind energy, and rough heavy particles are more difficult to be removed.</p>
  <p>3)Anthropogenic Soil Erosion<br>This type occurs due to anthropogenic factors, and human activities can induce soil erosion directly and indirectly. For example, a direct impact comes from mining and quarrying. Indirect consequences follow unsustainable management, disturbing the topsoil and increasing erodibility of fields and forest stands.</p>
